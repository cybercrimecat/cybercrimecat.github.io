      <p>alrighty, so recently theres been a couple allegations against me. the two main allegations being zoophilia and pedophilia. ill respond to them all here, give my side, any supporting evidence, stuff like that. to be honest i didnt really care enough to make a response, but seeing as completely uninvolved people are being targeted, ill do so now.</p>

		<h2>what exactly are the allegations?</h2>
		<p>in short, pedophilia and zoophilia.</p>
		<p>their proof for pedophilia is limited, they use screenshots and screenrecordings of telegram chats with me, in which i've sent them furry porn stickers. </p>

		<p><em>this image is sourced from one of the attacker's twitter page</em></p>
		<p>they've also uploaded multiple youtube videos and posted on youtube community pages repeating the allegations of pedophilia.</p>
		<p>their proof for zoophilia is actually somewhat solid. as evidence they use two screenshots - one which a telegram bot displays which telegram groups ive joined, the last group being "ZooFursUnity," the next screenshot showing my telegram account sending a message in said group, "hello hellooo."</p>

		<h2>response to pedophilia allegations</h2>
		<p>first, lets go through how this all started.</p>
		<p>a user on telegram (who will be referred to as "AD") messaged me with a supposed "dox" on me (which will be addressed in their impact) for hacking the Heritage Foundation. after sending me the dox, AD proceeded to throw insults at me, threaten to post my dox on doxbin, threaten me with the FBI, and send me edgy offensive memes in an attempt to get a reaction out of me.</p>
		<p>i responded carelessly, letting him talk and just brushing off his threats and insults. part of this careless response was sending furry porn because i noticed he was in an antifur community. once i sent furry porn, AD said "Now I have a reason" and continued with his threats. <strong>this alone proves his intent wasnt to combat pedophilia, but to attack me specifically</strong>, he was just looking for any reason at all, his first reason being the Heritage hack. to add to this, my age is similar to that of AD. i cant confirm my age due to opsec unfortunately, but it would certainly not be pedophilia. </p>
		<p><a href=https://files.catbox.moe/1doupt.txt>this is a full transcript of our chat logs</a> - with the timestamps, furry porn, and edgy memes removed.</p>
		<h2>response to the zoophilia allegations</h2>
		<p>to start with; yes! the screenshots are real. yet without the context of my past. </p>
		<p>years ago, i used to be involved in the Anonymous collective, supporting two major operations - Operation Child Safety and Operation Beast. both of these ops were intended to combat pedophilia and zoophilia using typical Anonymous techniques, doxxing and mass reporting. my primary job within these ops was to social engineer and dox pedos and zoos. my telegram account was previously used for social engineering, and i simply repurposed it into the identity that is now known as vio. </p>
		<p>but anyone can say this, right? so wheres my proof?</p>
		<p>my history in the Anonymous collective is public, my old anon name was YourAnonWolf. if you go looking youll find evidence of my involvement in targeting pedos and zoos. very few of my old doxes are still available unfortunately (pastebin moderation), but other proof remains. there is <a href=https://doxbin.com/upload/NicholasThorntonDoxzoophile>this one dox</a> (shitty dox ik x3), and also one of my old group's <a href=https://x.com/AxolotlSec>twitter page</a> remains. this is my old group from years ago, on the twitter page you can see we were involved in operations against pedos and zoos. </p>
		<p>to prove my involvement in AxoSec, <a href=https://www.darkowl.com/blog-content/darkowl-cyber-group-spotlight-siegedsec-and-leaked-data/>this article</a> states the leader of SiegedSec, YourAnonWolf (myself), is also involved in AxoSec.</p>
		<h2>who is accusing you of this?</h2>
		<p>the allegations come from a community of antifurs, they commonly also attack LGBTQ+ individuals, leftists, anyone that disagrees with them. theyre a pretty harmless community, usually just immature script kiddies or harassers. </p>
		<h2>what is their impact? </h2>
		<p>their impact overall is very minimal. they rely on surface level OSINT, harassment, and immature trolling. they "doxed" me a while ago, this dox consisted of my public social media pages, and an email data breach lookup of my public email address. none of the information was particularly sensitive, and to add to that, i voluntarily handed them nearly everything in their "dox" LMAO. </p>
		<p>while i didnt care about the dox attempt and harassment, i noticed AD teased a data breach of FurAffinity, claiming he found vulnerabilities and stole user information. after he sent me a doxbin link of the supposed data breach, it was obvious he had no hacking capability. it was all public stealer logs and compiled databreaches with the keyword "furaffinity," the formatting looked similar to that of a telegram bot. </p>
		<p>a friend of AD has also tipped me off about his further plans to DDoS my website. to put it simply, he cant do it. he was going to use a free booter website, but it certainly will not have the force needed to take down my website. </p>
		<h2>what will happen now?</h2>
		<p>to be honest, probably nothing. </p>
		<p>im not going to hack or dox AD or anyone in those communities, theyre harmless and not worth my time, and likely not going to force them to not harass uninvolved people. this post is intended to make things clear, for both curious people and attackers in the communities against me. </p>
