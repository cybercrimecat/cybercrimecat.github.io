      <p>across the years, i've received countless messages from people asking how to hack and if i can mentor them. i can't respond to each one individually, so this post will help you get started :3 this will primarily be a list of good resources ive used myself, or recommended by others i know. </p>
      <h2>fundamentals</h2>
		<p>before even starting hacking itself, its highly recommended you begin with the fundamentals. these are some of the most essential fundamentals:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>coding</li>
			<li>networking</li>
			<li>cryptography</li>
			<li>linux command line interface</li>
		</ul>
		<p>you may need to learn more depending on what youre focusing on. that brings me into your goal, which topic you want to focus on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>web application exploitation</li>
			<li>malware development</li>
			<li>reverse engineering</li>
			<li>binary exploitation</li>
			<li>internet of things (iot) exploitation</li>
			<li>network exploitation</li>
			<li>mobile app exploitation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>personally i focus on web application exploitation, network exploitation, reverse engineering, and mobile app exploitation. i recommend starting with web application exploitation, its the easiest in my opinion. </p>
		<p>learning the basic fundamentals could take a long time, but its really worth it to really understand hacking. without an understanding of the fundamentals, you cant really understand hacking, thus not being a hacker. i cant guide you through all the fundamentals, but <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RdqxojDVV7kKCRZ2QoFFOz0dNslreMOi>this google drive</a> <a href=https://catlitter.minoa.cat/api/view/hacky_books.zip>(archive)</a> contains many resources to learn both fundamentals and hacking itself (created by DaWolfieLegion!)</p>
		<p><a href=https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/please/>this post</a> by maia arson crimew also has good resources at the end, as well as its view on hacking and activism inspired by it.</p>
		<h2>hacking</h2>
		<p>here is some more resources for learning hacking once youve learned the fundamentals :3</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href=https://github.com/ghostsec420/SCPA/>Sophisticated Cyber Penetration Attacks</a></li>
			<li><a href=https://mlt.lol/blog.html>MLT's blog</a></li>
			<li><a href=https://johnjhacking.com/blog/>JohnJHacking's blog</a></li>
			<li><a href=https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/>maia arson crimew's blog</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>getting into ctfs and practice environments like tryhackme and hackthebox can be good learning tools too, although tbh i rarely used them myself. i always tried practicing on real targets instead of practice environments. imo blogs are one of the most important learning resources for reading about real world hacking experiences.</p>
		<p>one of the primary ways i learned was by going down rabbit holes of googling. id look up a hacking method and google anything i didnt understand, and if i didnt understand anything from that then id repeat, over and over again. </p>
		<h2>opsec</h2>
		<p>an important part of hacking is operational security, aka opsec. for learning operational security, i recommend these manuals:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href=https://ssd.eff.org/>EFF Surveillance Self Defense</a></li>
			<li><a href=https://fed.legal/fuckthefeds.pdf>FuckTheFeds PDF</a> <a href=https://catlitter.minoa.cat/api/view/d85916c464.pdf>(archive)</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>theres a lot to opsec, i recommend looking up opsec guides and figuring out what works best for you. i also highly recommend reading about how previous cybercriminals (such as pompompurin and omnipotent) got caught, and learn from their mistakes.</p>
		<h2>how i learned</h2>
		<p>i started learning in late 2020, initially inspired by the Anonymous collective's Operation Minneapolis. i didn't start out with the fundamentals, just went straight to learning sql injection and ddos. i was a classic script kiddy at the time, not fully understanding what i was doing, just blindly running scripts. my first *somewhat* big hack was against Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) for OpNigeria, although credit was taken by the ddoser Litemods. </p>
		<p>my main method of learning was googling something and keep googling down a rabbit hole of whatever i didnt understand, i was obsessed and learned 24/7. eventually with enough obsessive reading and practice, i got an understanding of the fundamentals. later i would learn the fundamentals more "officially" but at the time, i knew enough to surpass most anonymous hackers. </p>
		<p>as i sought to learn more, i joined hacking based discord servers and group chats. i met some pretty cool people that way, one of which being MLT from the old group <a href=https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamp0ison>TeamP0ison</a>, and i learned a lot from his blog. i also kept up with infosec twitter and learned a bit from there. </p>
		<p>ultimately, what helped me most was <strong>practice</strong>. specifically real world practice, just make sure you put enough time and effort into opsec before hacking the US govt. </p>
		<h2>conclusion</h2>
		<p>i hope this helps guide you to becoming a hacker. i'm hoping for more hackers with the same values as SiegedSec, fighting for the rights of others whilst having fun. in the paraphrased words of Emma Goldman,</p>
		<p><em>"If I can’t dance, I don’t want to be part of your revolution."</em></p>
