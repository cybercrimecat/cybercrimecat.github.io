          across the years, i've received countless messages from people asking how to hack and if i can mentor them. i can't respond to each one individually, so this post will help you get started :3 this will primarily be a list of good
          resources ive used myself, or recommended by others i know.
        </p>
        <h2>fundamentals</h2>
        <p>before even starting hacking itself, its highly recommended you begin with the fundamentals. these are some of the most essential fundamentals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>coding</li>
          <li>networking</li>
          <li>cryptography</li>
          <li>linux command line interface</li>
        </ul>
        <p>you may need to learn more depending on what youre focusing on. that brings me into your goal, which topic you want to focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>web application exploitation</li>
          <li>malware development</li>
          <li>reverse engineering</li>
          <li>binary exploitation</li>
          <li>internet of things (iot) exploitation</li>
          <li>network exploitation</li>
          <li>mobile app exploitation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>personally i focus on web application exploitation, network exploitation, reverse engineering, and mobile app exploitation. i recommend starting with web application exploitation, its the easiest in my opinion.</p>
        <p>
          learning the basic fundamentals could take a long time, but its really worth it to really understand hacking. without an understanding of the fundamentals, you cant really understand hacking, thus not being a hacker. i cant guide
          you through all the fundamentals, but <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RdqxojDVV7kKCRZ2QoFFOz0dNslreMOi">this google drive</a> contains many resources to learn both fundamentals and hacking itself (created by
          DaWolfieLegion!)
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/please/">this post</a> by maia arson crimew also has good resources at the end, as well as its view on hacking and activism inspired by it.</p>
        <h2>hacking</h2>
        <p>here is some more resources for learning hacking once youve learned the fundamentals :3</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/ghostsec420/SCPA/">Sophisticated Cyber Penetration Attacks</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://mlt.lol/blog.html">MLT's blog</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://johnjhacking.com/blog/">JohnJHacking's blog</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/">maia arson crimew's blog</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          getting into ctfs and practice environments like tryhackme and hackthebox can be good learning tools too, although tbh i rarely used them myself. i always tried practicing on real targets instead of practice environments. imo
          blogs are one of the most important learning resources for reading about real world hacking experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          one of the primary ways i learned was by going down rabbit holes of googling. id look up a hacking method and google anything i didnt understand, and if i didnt understand anything from that then id repeat, over and over again.
        </p>
        <h2>opsec</h2>
        <p>an important part of hacking is operational security, aka opsec. for learning operational security, i recommend these manuals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">EFF Surveillance Self Defense</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://fed.legal/fuckthefeds.pdf">FuckTheFeds PDF</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          theres a lot to opsec, i recommend looking up opsec guides and figuring out what works best for you. i also highly recommend reading about how previous cybercriminals (such as pompompurin and omnipotent) got caught, and learn from
          their mistakes.
        </p>
        <h2>how i learned</h2>
        <p>
          i started learning in late 2020, initially inspired by the Anonymous collective's Operation Minneapolis. i didn't start out with the fundamentals, just went straight to learning sql injection and ddos. i was a classic script kiddy
          at the time, not fully understanding what i was doing, just blindly running scripts. my first *somewhat* big hack was against Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) for OpNigeria, although credit was taken by the
          ddoser Litemods.
        </p>
        <p>
          my main method of learning was googling something and keep googling down a rabbit hole of whatever i didnt understand, i was obsessed and learned 24/7. eventually with enough obsessive reading and practice, i got an understanding
          of the fundamentals. later i would learn the fundamentals more "officially" but at the time, i knew enough to surpass most anonymous hackers.
        </p>
        <p>
          as i sought to learn more, i joined hacking based discord servers and group chats. i met some pretty cool people that way, one of which being MLT from the old group <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamp0ison">TeamP0ison</a>,
          and i learned a lot from his blog. i also kept up with infosec twitter and learned a bit from there.
        </p>
        <p>ultimately, what helped me most was <strong>practice</strong>. specifically real world practice, just make sure you put enough time and effort into opsec before hacking the US govt.</p>
        <h2>conclusion</h2>
        <p>i hope this helps guide you to becoming a hacker. i'm hoping for more hackers with the same values as SiegedSec, fighting for the rights of others whilst having fun. in the paraphrased words of Emma Goldman,</p>
